# source code of GP3
This file shows the Python and matlab code of SP, SG, LR and GP3 algorithm proposed in the paper "Adaptive Reliable Path Planning in Gaussian Process Regulated Environment".
# FIle of Python
The python folder contains the Python code for the four algorithms.
# File of maltlab
The maltlab folder contains the maltlab code for the four algorithms,and because the MATLAB code is too large to upload completely, only the sioux Falls road network is displayed in this folder.If you want complete data and codes, please contact 201821060832@std.uestc.edu.cn.
